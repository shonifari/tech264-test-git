# Basic Git understanding

Go to your folder of choice: 

```bash
cd /OneDrive/Documents/Github/tech264-test-git
```

Initialise the repository: 

```bash
git init
```

Create the README.md file: 

```bash
touch README.md
```

Modify the file

Add file to stage: 

```bash
git add README.md
```

Commit changes: 

```bash
git commit -m "My first commit"
```

Modify the file again

Add file to stage: 

```bash
git add README.md
```

Commit changes: 

```bash
git commit -m "My second commit"
```

Check the changes

git log
```

git checkout
```

git checkout HEAD~1 -- README.md
```


#### This command adds a remote repository to your local Git repository.
```bash
git remote add origin <github account>
```


#### This command renames your current branch to main.
The -M flag is used to forcefully rename the branch.
```bash
git branch -M main
```


#### This command pushes your local main branch to the remote repository named origin.
The -u flag sets the upstream tracking reference, meaning your local main branch will be linked to the remote main branch. This makes future pushes and pulls easier, as you wonâ€™t need to specify the branch name each time.
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
